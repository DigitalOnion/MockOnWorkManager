        <h1>Mock On WorkManager</h1>
        <p>This sample app shows how to create a test case for a Worker object injecting a fake dependency.</p>
        <p>The app is a very simple "Type and Reverse" app. For the purpose of the exercise, it uses a TextReverser to act as a text reverse server.</p>
        <p>I use a <strong>Worker</strong> to schedule a <strong>WorkManager</strong> task to call the text reverse server, and I inject the TextReverser object into the Worker task.</p>
        <p>The challenge is to create a test case which will inject a Fake Text Reverse Server.</p>
        <p>It works, check it out.</p>
        <p>Any questions?</p>
        <p>Ask Luis.</p>
